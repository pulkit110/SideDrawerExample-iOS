Side Drawer Navigation for iOS
==============================

This is an implementation of the approach described on [my post on side drawer navigation for iOS](http://pulkitgoyal.in/side-drawer-navigation-for-ios/). It can be used as a starter code for quickly adding side drawer using [`MMDrawerController`](https://github.com/mutualmobile/MMDrawerController) in a Storyboard based app.

Build
=====

Built with CocoaPods.

```
$ pod install
$ open SideDrawerExample.xcworkspace
```
